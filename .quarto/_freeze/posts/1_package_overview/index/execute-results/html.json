These add-ons are called `packages`. These are made available to everyone to download for free.\n\n\n> **Need R?** Follow these [installation steps](https://tidy-mn.github.io/R-camp-penguins/page/install.html).\n>\n> **Need access to data?** Submit a [Data related service request](https://mn-itservices-myit.us.onbmc.com/dwp/app/#/catalog).\n\n\n## Packages used for qualitative analysis\n\n> __General toolbox__\n\n<img src=\"../images/tidyverse_hex.png\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 2px;\" align=\"left\" width=\"132\">\n\n<br>\n\n`tidyverse`  The tidyverse is an umbrella of helpful packages. One of the included packages is the *readr* package, which helps import data into R from a variety of formats. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe core tidyverse packages we'll be using:\n\n- `readr` Load and save data stored as plain text, such as Comma Separated Values (CSVs).  \n- `dplyr` Clean, filter, transform, summarize and join data sets. \n- `stringr` Edit, clean, and precisely search through text. \n- `ggplot2` Plot, chart, and graph data.   \n\nSee the full list of tidyverse packages at the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).\n\n<br>\n\n>  Load data\n\n`readxl`    Load data from Excel.   \n`DBI`       Load data from databases with SQL.   \n`haven`     Load SAS, SPSS, and Stata files.  \n`janitor`   Clean and simplify column names and remove duplicates.\n     \n<br>\n\n>  Analyze text data\n\n`tidytext`     Tools to make text easier to analyze.\n`fuzzyjoin`    Tools to make join words that are approximately the same.\n`lubridate`    Tools to format dates and perform calculations based on time.  \n\n  \n<br>\n\n<div class=\"note\">\n\n### Add R packages\n\nTo use a _package_ you first need to install it -- much like an App on your phone. Copy the text below and paste it into the RStudio console. The console is found on the left-side of the screen when you open RStudio. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_packages <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidytext\", \"janitor\", \"curl\", \"stopwords\")\n\ninstall.packages(new_packages)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](../images/install_screen.png){style=\"margin-top: 4px; width: 75%;\"}\n\n<br>\n\nThen press `ENTER` to begin the installation. You should start to see some messages appear similar to below. These will provide information on the installation progress.\n\n![](../images/install_msg.png){width=\"75%\"}\n\n<br>\n\nDid it work? Try running the code below to load the `tidyverse` package from your library and see if it is installed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n## Additional recommended packages\n\n> __Charts and visuals__\n\n`hrbrthemes`, `ggthemes`   Chart themes for ggplot.  \n`rmarkdown`    Write summary reports and save as a PDF, Word document, presentation, or a web report.  \n\n<br>\n\n> __Load data__\n\n`sf`        Load data from GIS shapefiles.  \n`RODBC`     Load data from Oracle databases.  \n`RMySQL`, `RPostgresSQL`, and `RSQLite` for connecting to SQL databases.  \n`pdftools`  Read PDF documents.  \n`foreign`   Load data from Minitab and Systat.  \n`R.matlab`  Load data from Matlab.  \n\n<br>\n\n\n> __Maps__\n\n`tidycensus`   Download Census and American Community Survey data.  \n`leaflet`      Display spatial data and make interactive maps.\n\n<br>\n\n\n# Update `R packages`\n<hr>\n\nThere are two places to update R packages in RStudio.\n\n\n#### 1. In the `Files and Plots` area in the bottom right, under the `Packages` tab:\n\nClick the green __Update__ button next to Install.\n\n<img src=\"../images/updatepackages_1.PNG\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n\n<br>\n\n#### 2. In the `Tools` tab above at the top above the Code Editor:\n\nChoose the 2nd option -> _\"Check for Package Updates...\"_\n\n<img src=\"../images/updatepackages_2.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n\n<br>\n",
