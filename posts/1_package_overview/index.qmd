## Install `R packages`

R comes installed with many built-in functions and tools to help do your work. 

On top of this foundation referred to as _base R_, contributors create tools to make R easier to use and perform new tasks. These add-ons are called `packages`. These are made available to everyone to download for free.

## Packages used for qualitative analysis

`tidyverse`  The tidyverse is an umbrella of helpful packages. One of the included packages is the *readr* package, which helps import data into R from a variety of formats. 

<br><br>

The core tidyverse packages we'll be using:

- `readr` Load and save data stored as plain text, such as Comma Separated Values (CSVs).  
- `dplyr` Clean, filter, transform, summarize and join data sets. 
- `stringr` Edit, clean, and precisely search through text. 
- `ggplot2` Plot, chart, and graph data.   

See the full list of tidyverse packages at the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

<br>

>  Load data

`readxl`    Load data from Excel.   
`DBI`       Load data from databases with SQL.   
`haven`     Load SAS, SPSS, and Stata files.  
`janitor`   Clean and simplify column names and remove duplicates.
     
<br>

>  Analyze text data

`tidytext`     Tools to make text easier to analyze.
`fuzzyjoin`    Tools to make join words that are approximately the same.
`lubridate`    Tools to format dates and perform calculations based on time.

### Add R packages

To use a _package_ you first need to install it -- much like an App on your phone. Copy the text below and paste it into the RStudio console. The console is found on the left-side of the screen when you open RStudio. 


```{r, eval=F}
new_packages <- c("tidyverse", "tidytext", "janitor", "curl", "stopwords")

install.packages(new_packages)
```


![](../images/install_screen.png){style="margin-top: 4px; width: 75%;"}

<br>

Then press `ENTER` to begin the installation. You should start to see some messages appear similar to below. These will provide information on the installation progress.

![](../images/install_msg.png){width="75%"}

<br>

Did it work? Try running the code below to load the `tidyverse` package from your library and see if it is installed.

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Update `R packages`
<hr>

There are two places to update R packages in RStudio.


#### 1. In the `Files and Plots` area in the bottom right, under the `Packages` tab:

Click the green __Update__ button next to Install.

#### 2. In the `Tools` tab above at the top above the Code Editor:

Choose the 2nd option -> _"Check for Package Updates..."_
